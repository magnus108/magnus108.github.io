#USS Midway Museum

Today I went to the USS Midway Museum.
This museum is huge and one can spend many hours there.
I was almost alone walking around the ship which felt really strange.
In the evening I met up with Ellen and her friend Pauline to go find stranded
fish on the beach. We didnâ€™t find any. However, we did get a drink with some alaskans.
