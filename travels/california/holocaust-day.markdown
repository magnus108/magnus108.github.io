#Holocaust Day


Today i went to Ellenâ€™s school for a Holocaust memorial walk thing.

We also spoke about these two peter Kien and Robert geminder.

After that Ellen and I did some studying and went to the Hillel House
to make some chairty breads.

On a lighter note today was also national grilled cheese sandwich day.
This ment i had to grill some awesome super cheesy sandwiches in the evening
for Ellen and I.
