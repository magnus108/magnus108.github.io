#Sleepless in Seattle

After traveling for 15 hours, I did sleep.
I stayed at a hotel just outside the Seattle airport.
Here I would be doing a stopover before heading to San Diego.
The hotel was fine. Everything else less so.


*Notes: Donâ€™t use the airport shuttle if The walk only takes 15 minuets.
There is only horrible food in the area.*
