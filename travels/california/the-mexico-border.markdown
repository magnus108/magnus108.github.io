#The Mexico Border

Today Ellen and I drove home to San Diego from Joshua Tree.
We took the rute through Joshua Tree and down Salton Lake.
Here we stopped by the international banana museum.
This was a really cool spot.
We then went to some strange tower and drove down to see Trumps Wall.
From here we drove up some mountain and arrived home really late.
As a consequence, we ordered Papa Johns for dinner.
