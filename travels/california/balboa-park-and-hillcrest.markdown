#Balboa Park and Hillcrest

Today Ellen and I went around Balboa park.
We saw the Japanese friendship garden and the botanical garden.
Later we went to the worlds first openly gay brewery for some beer tasting.
This brewery is found in Hillcrest which is a really cool place.
In the evening we met up with Ellenâ€™s friend and went to a cool bar in University Heights.
Here we got a drink with tequila, cucumber and ginger which was really good.
