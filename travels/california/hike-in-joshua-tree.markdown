#Hike in Joshua Tree

Today Ellen and I went for a hike in Joshua Tree.
We went along the boy scouts trail.
This took a few hours.
We then put up our tents at a really nice spot by the Twin Tanks.
This time it was not already dark and we had a nice evening eating great food
and we saw some shooting stars.
My stomach was not feeling very good which was a problem. However, we still had fun..
