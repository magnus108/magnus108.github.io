#San Diego Zoo

Today Ellen and I went to the San Diego Zoo and it is amazing!
We saw all the animals, this includes pandas, snow leopards, and a funny monkey.
The zoo is huge and we didnâ€™t have time to do anything else this day.
The weather was also perfect today.

*Note: the food in the San Diego zoo is horrible.*
