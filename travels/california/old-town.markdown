#Old Town San Diego

Today I drove downtown and walked around the Gaslamp Quarter.
This place has a lot of huge restaurants but not a lot else.
From here I walked to the seaport village which was alright.
Later I drove to old town to meet up with Ellen.
Old town is very touristy and only has Mexican restaurant and a cool cigar bar.
As a consequence, Ellen and I drove back to Little Italy to have some pasta for dinner..
